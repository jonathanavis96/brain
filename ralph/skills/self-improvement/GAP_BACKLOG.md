# Gap Backlog (Auto-maintained by Claude)

Rules:
- Each entry is a missing brain capability discovered during work.
- If a similar entry exists, **UPDATE it** (don't duplicate).
- Include evidence (paths, filenames, brief snippets, or observations).
- Priority:
  - P0 = blocks work / repeatedly causes failure
  - P1 = high leverage / recurring
  - P2 = nice-to-have
