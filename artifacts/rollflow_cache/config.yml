# RollFlow Cache Configuration
#
# This file configures cache behavior for the Ralph loop's tool execution caching system.
# The cache stores PASS results to avoid re-running identical tool calls.

# Tools that should never be cached (always run fresh)
# Add tool names that have side effects or are non-deterministic
non_cacheable_tools:
  # Example: Tools that modify state or depend on external factors
  # - git_push
  # - deploy_script
  # - random_generator

# Maximum age for cached entries (in hours)
# Entries older than this are treated as cache misses
# Default: 168 hours (7 days)
max_cache_age_hours: 168

# Cache behavior settings
cache_settings:
  # Enable/disable cache globally (can be overridden by --cache-skip flag)
  enabled: true

  # Git SHA staleness check (requires git SHA match for cache hit)
  check_git_sha: true

  # Verbose cache logging (useful for debugging)
  verbose: false
