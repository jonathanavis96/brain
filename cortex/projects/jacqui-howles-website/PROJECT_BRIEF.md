## Project Goals

1. **Improve conversion** - Site attracts and converts more suitable clients
2. **Calm, welcoming, professional** - Not overly feminine
3. **Avoid information overload** - On landing page while preserving all details across site
4. **Less text-heavy** - Use layout patterns (quotes, images/photos, spacing, short sections) without losing content

---

## Required Additions

1. **Re-add "in-person services"** alongside online services (clearly and accurately)
2. **Add Psychology Today verification** - Client will provide verification code; include placeholder and specify placement
3. **Modular copy** - Text will be edited by Jacqui later, keep easy to tweak

## Deliverables

- Content mapping from current site to each section
- Recommended CTAs per section with wording
- Suggested placements for images/photos and pull-quotes
- Trust elements placement (HPCSA + Psychology Today placeholder)

### 2. Homepage Strategy

### 3. Improved Flow

- "How to start" pathway for new clients (steps, expectations, session length)
- Clear split between:
  - Online vs In-person
  - Individuals / Adolescents / Couples

### 4. Copy Improvements (Light-Touch)

- Revised headings + short "scannable" summaries for each section
- Do NOT invent new claims or credentials
- Keep wording truthful and conservative

### 5. Open Questions for Jono to Ask Jacqui

## Structural Rules

### Rule 1: Landing Page = Overview Without Overload

| Landing Page Shows | Detailed Pages Show |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Who she is (brief) | Full bio (About) |
| What she offers (summary) | All service details (Services) |
| Trust markers | Full credentials |
| Primary CTA | Multiple contact options |

**Landing page uses short summaries + links to detailed sections**

### Rule 2: Design = Calm, Inviting, Not Overly Feminine

- Visual tone and typography: rounded/soft font, clean spacing
- Copy: warm and professional, not "floral" or overly soft in styling

### Rule 3: Layout = Avoid Walls of Text

Same detail, but broken up using:
- Section headings
- Short paragraphs
- Pull quotes
- Photos/images between sections
- Accordions/toggles for long lists (optional)

**Preserves 100% of details while improving scan-ability**

### Rule 4: Trust = Add Psychology Today Verification

- Add widget/badge using Jacqui's verification code
- Placement: Homepage + About, maybe Contact
- Supports conversions

### Rule 5: In-Person Services = Addition

- Services page: "In-person therapy/coaching" section alongside online
- Homepage: services summary mentions both "online + in-person" (if accurate)
- Contact page: clarify location/availability for in-person

## Page Structure (Practical)

| Page | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Homepage** | Brief intro + short service overview + trust markers (HPCSA + Psychology Today) + 1-2 quotes + CTA |
| **About** | Full detailed story + approach + "what I work with" + credentials + quote |
| **Services** | All existing service detail + add in-person section + keep consultancy list |
| **Contact** | Current contact info + optionally add in-person logistics (area, days, booking method) |

---

## Constraints

- **Preserve meaning and completeness** - No content lost, only reorganised and improved
- **Clear, simple language** - General audience understands
- **Prioritise UX** - Clean, calming user experience
- **Obvious booking/contact path** - Easy conversion flow
