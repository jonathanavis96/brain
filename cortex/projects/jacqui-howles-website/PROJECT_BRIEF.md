# Project Brief: Jacqui Howles Psychology Website

**Client:** Jacqui Howles (solo counselling psychologist)
**Existing Site:** <https://www.jacquichowles.com/>
**Deadline:** 14th February 2026 (Psychology Today renewal date - $276/year)
**Status:** Discovery phase

---

## Confirmed Requirements (From Client Conversation)

These are the actual confirmed details from the conversation with Jacqui/Jono:

### Timeline & Logistics

- 14th Feb resubbed Psychology Today - need site before then ($276/year)
- Beginning of Jan paid for domain - can transfer domain
- Client describes current website creation as "horrible process"
- No business card currently - website serves as digital card when shared in chat

### Content Rules

**1) Content stays (current site detail set)**

Keep all existing copy themes and detail blocks already on the site:

- Full "About" narrative (background, Wits, CSVR, work across Africa, The Gambia, UNDP, online base, etc.)
- "How I work" (psychodynamic primary + other modalities, safe relationship-focused approach)
- "What I work with" list (trauma/PTSD/complex PTSD, depression incl postpartum, anxiety, grief, burnout, transitions, identity, couples, etc.)
- Services breakdown:
  - Online therapy/coaching (getting started + structure/payment)
  - Consultancy services list (training, community programs, workplace workshops, mentorship, body mapping, content development)
- Contact details (email + WhatsApp only phone)
- Existing CTAs ("Learn more", "Get in touch", "Book a consultation")
- Credentials/HPCSA info

**2) Presentation rules (not deletions)**

- **Landing page rule:** "overview without overload"
  - Landing page covers: who she is + what she offers + trust markers + CTA
  - Long-form detail stays on About and Services pages
  - Landing page uses short summaries + links to detailed sections (details still exist, just not all shown at once)

- **Design rule:** calm, inviting, not overly feminine
  - Visual tone and typography choices (rounded/soft font, clean spacing)
  - Copy can remain warm and professional; not "floral" or overly soft in styling

- **Layout rule:** avoid walls of text
  - Same detail, but broken up using:
    - Section headings
    - Short paragraphs
    - Pull quotes
    - Photos/images between sections
    - Accordions/toggles for long lists (optional)
  - Preserves 100% of details while improving scan-ability

- **Trust rule:** add Psychology Today verification
  - Add widget/badge using Jacqui's verification code
  - Place where it supports conversions (typically homepage + about, maybe contact)

- **Content note:** add in-person services again
  - Services page gets "In-person therapy/coaching" section alongside online
  - Homepage services summary mentions both "online + in-person" (if accurate)
  - Contact page can clarify location/availability for in-person

**3) Structural outcome (practically)**

| Page | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Homepage** | Brief intro + short service overview + trust markers (HPCSA + Psychology Today) + 1-2 quotes + CTA |
| **About** | Full detailed story + approach + "what I work with" + credentials + quote |
| **Services** | All existing service detail + add in-person section + keep consultancy list |
| **Contact** | Current contact info + optionally add in-person logistics (area, days, booking method) |

### Open Questions for Jono to Ask Jacqui

- [ ] More quotes needed?
- [ ] Aesthetic preferences (colours, photo style, vibe references)?
- [ ] In-person logistics (where, when, availability, pricing differences)?

You are an expert conversion-focused web strategist + UX copywriter for solo psychology practices.

**Context**

- Client: Jacqui Howles (solo counselling psychologist).
- Existing site: <https://www.jacquichowles.com/>
- You must first read that site to understand:
  - Current page structure: Home, About, Services, Contact
  - Current tone and all existing content blocks (do not drop details)
  - Current CTAs and trust markers already present

**Non-negotiables (do NOT remove any details)**

- Keep ALL existing details and meaning currently on the site, including:
  - Full bio/story and background
  - Approach ("how I work") and modalities framing
  - "What I work with" areas (trauma/PTSD/complex PTSD, depression incl postpartum, anxiety, grief, burnout, identity, transitions, couples, etc.)
  - Current services structure (online therapy/coaching + consultancy offerings)
  - Contact details and current CTAs
  - Credentials/HPCSA information
- Your job is to RESTRUCTURE and RE-PRESENT the information for better clarity and conversion, not to cut content.

**Project goals**

- Improve the website so it attracts and converts more suitable clients.
- Keep the overall feel calm, welcoming, and professional (not overly feminine).
- Avoid "information overload" on the landing page while still preserving all details across the site.
- Make the site less text-heavy by using layout patterns (quotes, images/photos, spacing, short sections) without losing content.

**Required additions**

- Re-add "in-person services" alongside online services (clearly and accurately).
- Add Psychology Today verification (client will provide verification code; include a placeholder and specify where it should go).
- Text will be edited by Jacqui later, so keep copy modular and easy to tweak.

**Design + style direction**

- Clean and simple text presentation
- Rounded / softer font feel (not harsh, square, or overly clinical)
- Use quotes, images, and photos so pages aren't walls of text
- Keep navigation simple and consistent; make CTAs easy to find

**What to produce**

1) A conversion-optimised site blueprint that keeps all existing details:
   - For each page (Home, About, Services, Contact):
     - Section-by-section outline (ordered)
     - What content from the current site goes into each section (explicit mapping)
     - Recommended CTAs per section and their wording
     - Suggested placements for images/photos and pull-quotes
     - Trust elements placement (HPCSA info + Psychology Today verification placeholder)
2) Recommended homepage strategy:
   - How to give a quick overview without overload
   - What stays above the fold vs what links out to About/Services
3) Improved flow:
   - "How to start" pathway for new clients (steps, expectations, session length)
   - Clear split between Online vs In-person and for Individuals/Adolescents/Couples
4) Copy improvements (light-touch):
   - Provide revised headings + short "scannable" summaries for each section
   - Do not invent new claims or credentials; keep wording truthful and conservative
5) A short list of open questions for Jono to ask Jacqui:
   - Whether more quotes are needed
   - Aesthetic preferences (colours, photo style, vibe references)
   - In-person logistics (where, when, availability, pricing differences if any)

**Constraints**

- Preserve meaning and completeness: no content should be lost, only reorganised and improved.
- Write in clear, simple language that a general audience understands.
- Prioritise a clean, calming user experience and an obvious booking/contact path.
