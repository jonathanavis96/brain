<!-- Cortex adds new Task Contracts below this line -->

## Phase 0-Lint: Markdown Lint Fixes

**Context:** Auto-fix could not resolve these markdown errors. Manual fixes required.

**Goal:** All markdown files pass `markdownlint` with zero errors.

**Tasks:**

- [x] **0.L.1** Fix MD046 in cortex/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md line 50
  - **Issue:** Indented code block should be fenced
  - **AC:** `markdownlint cortex/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` passes (no MD046 errors)

- [x] **0.L.2** Fix MD024 in cortex/PLAN_DONE.md lines 341, 347
  - **Issue:** Duplicate headings "Archived on 2026-01-27"
  - **AC:** `markdownlint cortex/PLAN_DONE.md` passes (no MD024 errors)

- [ ] **0.L.3** Fix MD046 in workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md lines 40, 55
  - **Issue:** Indented code blocks should be fenced
  - **AC:** `markdownlint workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` passes (no MD046 errors)

- [ ] **0.L.4** Fix MD007 in workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md lines 46-48, 77-79, 90-92
  - **Issue:** Unordered list indentation (Expected: 0; Actual: 2)
  - **AC:** `markdownlint workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` passes (no MD007 errors)

- [ ] **0.L.5** Fix MD005 in workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md line 94
  - **Issue:** Inconsistent indentation for list items at the same level
  - **AC:** `markdownlint workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` passes (no MD005 errors)

## Phase 30: Brain Map UX Refinements (2 hours) 🎨

**Context:** After Phase 29 quick wins, polish the graph navigation and rendering for production quality.

**Goal:** Professional graph UX with proper navigation controls, smart label rendering, and clean layout.

**Success Criteria:**

- User never "loses" position in graph (fit-to-screen button or minimap)
- Labels render intelligently (hover-only mode, zoom-based sizing)
- Inspector layout is clean (no overlapping panels)

---

### Task 30.1: Proper cluster mode switching

- [ ] **30.1.1** Refactor cluster rebuild to use `showClusters` boolean - Use `useMemo` to derive `showClusters` from `zoomLevel < 0.5`, then use in useEffect deps instead of raw zoomLevel. AC: Graph rebuild fires only when boolean flips. Verification: Console.log fires only at threshold crossing. If Blocked: 29.1.2 already handles this; skip if satisfied

---

### Task 30.2: Navigation controls (fit-to-screen + reset)

- [ ] **30.2.1** Add "Fit to Screen" button - Add button to GraphView bottom-right that calls `sigmaRef.current.getCamera().animatedReset()`. AC: Click button → graph zooms out to show all nodes. Verification: Pan far away → click Fit → all nodes visible. If Blocked: Use `setState({ x: 0, y: 0, ratio: 1 })` as simpler alternative

- [ ] **30.2.2** Add zoom controls (+/- buttons) - Add +/- buttons next to Fit button that call `animatedZoom()` and `animatedUnzoom()`. AC: +/- buttons zoom in/out smoothly. Verification: Click + 3 times → zooms in; click - 3 times → zooms out. If Blocked: Lower priority; skip if time constrained

- [ ] **30.2.3** Add minimap or breadcrumb indicator
  - **Goal:** Show user where they are in the graph when panned away from center
  - **Options:**
    - **Minimap:** Small thumbnail of full graph with viewport indicator (requires canvas overlay)
    - **Breadcrumb:** "Viewing: Cluster X / Node Y" indicator (simpler)
    - **Center distance:** "50m from center" indicator (cheapest)
  - **Recommendation:** Start with breadcrumb (show selected node path)
  - **AC:** User can see current location context even when panned far from origin
  - **Verification:** Pan away → indicator shows "Viewing: Node ABC" or similar
  - **If Blocked:** Skip for MVP; reconsider if user testing shows disorientation

---

### Task 30.3: Smart label rendering

- [ ] **30.3.1** Implement hover-only label mode - Custom label reducer that renders labels only for `data.highlighted || data.hovered` nodes, add enterNode/leaveNode handlers to set hovered attribute. AC: Labels appear only on hover. Verification: Mouse over → label appears; move away → disappears. If Blocked: Lower priority; 29.2.1 threshold sufficient

- [ ] **30.3.2** Zoom-based label sizing - Set `labelSize: Math.max(10, Math.min(16, 12 * zoomLevel))` to scale font size with zoom level. AC: Labels grow/shrink as user zooms in/out. Verification: Zoom in → bigger labels; zoom out → smaller labels. If Blocked: Skip; static size fine for MVP

---

### Task 30.4: Inspector layout cleanup

- [ ] **30.4.1** Fix `InsightsPanel` positioning (remove `position: fixed`)
  - **Goal:** Make Insights panel part of natural document flow (no overlay)
  - **File:** `app/brain-map/frontend/src/InsightsPanel.jsx` line 45
  - **Change:** Remove `position: fixed` and adjust `App.jsx` layout to use flexbox properly
  - **Implementation:**
    - In `InsightsPanel.jsx`: Remove `position: fixed, top, right, width` (let parent control sizing)
    - In `App.jsx`: Ensure right column uses `display: flex, flexDirection: column` and panels use `flex: 1`
  - **AC:** Hotspots and form fields never overlap; both scroll naturally within right panel
  - **Verification:** Resize window → panels stay in column; no overlapping elements
  - **If Blocked:** 29.3.1 collapsible is sufficient; skip layout refactor

- [ ] **30.4.2** Add proper scrolling to right panel
  - **Goal:** Long Hotspots lists or node bodies scroll within panel (don't push form fields off screen)
  - **Implementation:** Add `overflow-y: auto` and `max-height` to scrollable sections
  - **AC:** Hotspots list with 20+ items scrolls within panel; form fields always visible below
  - **Verification:** Add 20 fake hotspot entries → list scrolls; form fields still visible
  - **If Blocked:** Lower priority; most graphs won't have 20+ hotspots

---

## Task Dependencies

**Phase 29 (parallel execution allowed):**

- 29.1.1 → 29.1.2 (derived state depends on removing zoomLevel from deps)
- 29.2.1 independent
- 29.3.1 independent

**Phase 30:**

- 30.1.1 depends on 29.1.2 (or supersedes it)
- 30.2.1-30.2.3 independent (navigation controls)
- 30.3.1-30.3.2 independent (label rendering)
- 30.4.1 → 30.4.2 (layout refactor before scroll tuning)

**Critical path:** 29.1.1 → 29.1.2 → 30.2.1 (zoom fix → fit-to-screen button)

---

## Phase 31: Brain Map V2 - Core Interactions 🔥

**Context:** User testing feedback - need node dragging, drag-to-link edge creation, dark mode, and mobile support for production use.

**Goal:** Transform Brain Map from static visualization to interactive knowledge graph editor.

**Success Criteria:**

- User can drag nodes to custom positions (persisted to frontmatter)
- User can drag from node A to node B to create link
- Dark mode by default with theme toggle
- Hotspots moved to left sidebar (below Recency filter)
- Mobile/tablet touch support (pinch-zoom, pan, tap)

---

### Task 31.1: Node Dragging & Position Persistence

- [ ] **31.1.1** Enable Sigma drag mode - Set `sigma.setSetting('enableCameraMovement', false)` when dragging node, add `dragNode` and `dropNode` event handlers to GraphView.jsx. AC: User can click-drag node to new position. Verification: Drag node → position updates in real-time. If Blocked: Check Sigma docs for drag event API

- [ ] **31.1.2** Persist node positions to frontmatter - On `dropNode` event, POST to new `/node/{id}/position` endpoint with `{x, y}` coords, backend writes to markdown frontmatter `position: {x: 123, y: 456}`. AC: Reload page → node stays in dragged position. Verification: Drag node, refresh browser, node is in same spot. If Blocked: Store in localStorage as temporary solution

- [ ] **31.1.3** Add "Lock Layout" toggle - Button in top-right controls to switch between manual (draggable) and auto-layout (ForceAtlas2) modes. AC: Toggle on → nodes lockable; toggle off → force-directed layout resumes. Verification: Lock layout, drag nodes, unlock, nodes animate back to force positions. If Blocked: Default to manual mode only

- [ ] **31.1.4** Load saved positions on graph render - Backend includes `position` in `/graph` response, frontend uses saved coords if present (skip random x/y). AC: Nodes with saved positions render at those coords; unsaved nodes use force layout. Verification: Mix of saved/unsaved nodes renders correctly. If Blocked: All-or-nothing (either all manual or all auto)

---

### Task 31.2: Drag-to-Link Edge Creation

- [ ] **31.2.1** Detect drag-for-link gesture - On node mousedown, check if Shift key held → enter link mode (show dashed line following cursor). AC: Shift+drag from node shows link preview line. Verification: Shift+drag → dashed line appears; release Shift → cancels. If Blocked: Use right-click drag as alternative trigger

- [ ] **31.2.2** Highlight link target on hover - During link drag, detect when cursor over another node → highlight target with glow effect. AC: Hover over target node → visual feedback. Verification: Drag link line over multiple nodes → each highlights. If Blocked: Skip hover feedback; just support drop

- [ ] **31.2.3** Create link on drop - On drop over target node, POST to `/node/{source_id}` with updated `links: [target_id]` array, backend updates source markdown frontmatter. AC: Drop creates link, graph refreshes showing new edge. Verification: Shift+drag node A to B → edge appears, markdown updated. If Blocked: Show "Link created" modal with undo button

- [ ] **31.2.4** Visual feedback for link creation - Toast notification on success ("Link created: A → B"), error handling for self-links or duplicates. AC: Success toast shows for 3 seconds. Verification: Create link → toast appears; try duplicate → error message. If Blocked: Console.log only

---

### Task 31.3: Dark Mode & Theme System

- [ ] **31.3.1** Implement dark theme CSS variables - Create theme object with light/dark palettes (background, text, panels, borders, node colors), apply via CSS-in-JS or style props. AC: Dark theme renders correctly (readable text, good contrast). Verification: Toggle theme → colors switch. If Blocked: Start with dark-only, add toggle later

- [ ] **31.3.2** Add theme toggle button - Sun/moon icon in header (top-right), onClick toggles theme and saves to localStorage. AC: Toggle persists across sessions. Verification: Set dark mode, refresh → still dark. If Blocked: Use browser `prefers-color-scheme` detection only

- [ ] **31.3.3** Adjust node colors for dark mode - Slightly desaturate node type colors for dark backgrounds (task green, concept blue, etc. → darker shades). AC: Node colors readable on dark canvas. Verification: Dark mode → all node types distinguishable. If Blocked: Keep light-mode colors, just change canvas background

- [ ] **31.3.4** Set dark mode as default - Initialize theme state to 'dark', show light mode as opt-in. AC: First load shows dark mode. Verification: Fresh browser session → dark mode active. If Blocked: Respect `prefers-color-scheme` instead of forcing dark

---

### Task 31.4: Move Hotspots to Left Sidebar

- [ ] **31.4.1** Move Hotspots component from InsightsPanel to FilterPanel - Cut Hotspots section from `InsightsPanel.jsx` lines 58-235, paste into `FilterPanel.jsx` after Recency dropdown (after line 157). AC: Hotspots appear in left sidebar below filters. Verification: Open app → Hotspots in left panel. If Blocked: Create duplicate initially, remove from right later

- [ ] **31.4.2** Style Hotspots for left sidebar - Match FilterPanel styling (compact, no wide padding), limit to top 5 hotspots with "Show more" expansion. AC: Hotspots fit naturally in left sidebar width (300px). Verification: Hotspots list doesn't overflow or break layout. If Blocked: Use accordion/collapse to save space

- [ ] **31.4.3** Update InsightsPanel layout - Remove empty space where Hotspots were, ensure form fields (ID, Title, Type, Status, Tags, Body) take full height. AC: Right panel shows node details only. Verification: Select node → right panel shows form fields cleanly. If Blocked: Keep old layout, hide Hotspots section

---

### Task 31.5: Mobile & Touch Support

- [ ] **31.5.1** Add touch event handlers - Implement pinch-to-zoom (two-finger pinch), pan (single-finger drag on canvas), tap-to-select (single tap on node). AC: Pinch zoom works on mobile. Verification: Test on phone/tablet simulator → gestures work. If Blocked: Desktop-only for now, document mobile as Phase 34

- [ ] **31.5.2** Optimize layout for mobile screens - Media queries for <768px width: collapse sidebars, show hamburger menu, make graph full-screen. AC: Mobile layout usable (no horizontal scroll). Verification: Resize browser to 375px width → UI adapts. If Blocked: Min-width warning ("Desktop recommended")

- [ ] **31.5.3** Add mobile-friendly controls - Larger touch targets (48px min), floating action buttons for zoom/fit-to-screen, bottom sheet for node details. AC: Controls tappable on mobile without precision. Verification: Tap controls on phone → no mis-taps. If Blocked: Increase button size only

- [ ] **31.5.4** Handle long-press for context menu - Long-press node → show context menu (Edit, Delete, Create Link, View Details). AC: Long-press triggers menu. Verification: Long-press node on mobile → menu appears. If Blocked: Skip context menu, use double-tap to edit

---

## Phase 32: Brain Map V2 - Discovery & Intelligence 🧠

- User can save/load filtered views
- Visual query builder for complex filters

---

### Task 32.1: Path Finder

- [ ] **32.1.1** Add "Find Path" mode - Toolbar button activates path-finding mode, prompts "Select start node, then end node". AC: Click Find Path → mode activates. Verification: Button shows "active" state. If Blocked: Use command palette (Ctrl+P) instead

- [ ] **32.1.2** Implement shortest path algorithm - Backend endpoint `/path?from={id}&to={id}` returns shortest path using BFS/Dijkstra on edge graph. AC: Returns array of node IDs in path order. Verification: Request path between known nodes → correct path returned. If Blocked: Use graphology `shortestPath()` client-side

- [ ] **32.1.3** Highlight path on graph - Render path nodes with glow effect, edges in path with bright color (e.g., cyan), fade non-path elements. AC: Path visually distinct. Verification: Find path → highlighted nodes/edges clear. If Blocked: Just zoom to fit path nodes

- [ ] **32.1.4** Show path metadata - Display path length, intermediate nodes, estimated "semantic distance" (based on edge weights). AC: Path info panel shows details. Verification: Find path → see "4 hops via Node X, Y, Z". If Blocked: Just show node count

---

### Task 32.2: AI-Powered Insights

- [ ] **32.2.1** Implement auto-tagging suggestions - Backend analyzes node body text, suggests tags using keyword extraction (TF-IDF or simple regex). AC: API endpoint `/node/{id}/suggest-tags` returns tag array. Verification: Request suggestions for sample note → relevant tags returned. If Blocked: Use predefined tag dictionary matching

- [ ] **32.2.2** Orphan node detection - Backend identifies nodes with zero edges (in/out degree = 0), returns list via `/insights/orphans`. AC: Orphans endpoint works. Verification: Create isolated node → appears in orphans list. If Blocked: Client-side filter (graph.nodes.filter(n => graph.degree(n) === 0))

- [ ] **32.2.3** Bridge node identification - Calculate betweenness centrality (nodes that connect disparate clusters), highlight top 5 in UI. AC: Bridge nodes marked with icon. Verification: Manually create bridge topology → correct nodes identified. If Blocked: Skip betweenness, use degree centrality (most connected)

- [ ] **32.2.4** Stale note alerts - Flag nodes with `updated_at > 90 days`, show in insights panel with "Update recommended". AC: Stale nodes listed. Verification: Create old note → appears in stale list. If Blocked: Use recency metric already implemented

---

### Task 32.3: Saved Views & Bookmarks

- [ ] **32.3.1** Add "Save View" button - Captures current filter state + zoom + camera position, stores in localStorage with user-defined name. AC: Save View → prompts for name → saved. Verification: Save view "My Project" → appears in views list. If Blocked: Save filters only (not camera state)

- [ ] **32.3.2** Create Views dropdown in header - List of saved views, click to load (applies filters, restores camera). AC: Dropdown shows saved views. Verification: Load saved view → graph state restored. If Blocked: Use bookmarks panel in sidebar

- [ ] **32.3.3** Implement view sharing - "Share View" generates URL with encoded filter params (e.g., `/graph?view=base64encodedstate`). AC: Copy link, open in new tab → same view. Verification: Share link to another user → they see same filtered graph. If Blocked: Copy filter JSON to clipboard

- [ ] **32.3.4** Add default views - Preset views: "All Tasks", "Blocked Items", "Recent Activity (7d)", "Orphans". AC: Default views available on first load. Verification: Fresh session → 4 default views shown. If Blocked: Just document filter examples in help

---

### Task 32.4: Visual Query Builder

- [ ] **32.4.1** Create filter chip UI - Drag-and-drop chips for filter criteria (Type=task, Status=blocked, Tags contains X, Recency=7d). AC: Filter chips render in panel. Verification: Add chips → filter updates. If Blocked: Use form inputs only (existing FilterPanel)

- [ ] **32.4.2** Implement AND/OR logic - Support complex queries: "(Type=task OR Type=decision) AND Status=active". AC: Boolean logic works. Verification: Build complex filter → correct nodes shown. If Blocked: AND-only logic (all conditions must match)

- [ ] **32.4.3** Add filter preview count - Show "X nodes match" before applying filter. AC: Preview count updates as chips change. Verification: Adjust filter → count updates live. If Blocked: Apply-then-count (no preview)

- [ ] **32.4.4** Save filter as named view - "Save as View" button in query builder creates reusable saved view. AC: Query builder state saved. Verification: Build complex query → save → reload → works. If Blocked: Manual JSON export

---
