I'll analyze the task and implement the graceful fallback logic.

Looking at the current implementation, I need to add a check that validates
the extracted block has the required structure before proceeding with cleanup.

The fallback should provide iteration metadata and a clean excerpt of the log.

Implementing the changes now...
