I'll start by checking the verifier status and then proceed with the BUILD workflow.

STATUS | branch=main | runner=rovodev | model=claude-sonnet-4-20250514

PROGRESS | phase=build | step=check_verifier | tasks=0/0 | file=.verify/latest.txt

Let me check the verifier status:```bash
cat .verify/latest.txt
```
