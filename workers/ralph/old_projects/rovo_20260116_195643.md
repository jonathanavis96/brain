# Project: rovo

Location: /home/grafe/code/rovo-test
Purpose: Automate Atlassian account creation and token management for scaled development operations. The system will handle the complete lifecycle of Atlassian accounts including creation, verification, token generation, secure storage, and rotation.
Tech Stack: PowerShell, Bash, Selenium, GPG, Python
Goals: Create 2,048 Atlassian accounts with automated verification, achieve 95%+ success rate for account creation, implement secure token rotation system, GPG-encrypted credential storage, automated token expiry tracking and renewal, parallel account processing for efficiency

## Success Criteria
- Successfully create and verify 2,048 accounts
- Token rotation occurs automatically before expiry
- All credentials stored with GPG encryption
- System recovers gracefully from failures
- Achieve target 95%+ success rate
- Complete documentation for setup and operation

## Technical Requirements
- Selenium WebDriver for browser automation
- GPG for credential encryption/decryption
- PowerShell scripts for Windows compatibility
- Bash scripts for Linux/WSL2 automation
- Python for complex orchestration logic
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Logging system for audit trail
