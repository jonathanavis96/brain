# Cortex Thoughts - {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**Last Updated:** {{TIMESTAMP}}

## Current Mission

{{PROJECT_PURPOSE}}

**Status:** Initial planning phase - project just bootstrapped

## Strategic Analysis

### Project Context

**Type:** {{PROJECT_TYPE}}  
**Tech Stack:** {{TECH_STACK}}

**Key Objectives:**
{{PROJECT_GOALS}}

### Initial Assessment

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Ralph infrastructure in place
- ✅ Verifier system configured
- ✅ Template structure generated

**Risks:**

- ⚠️ Project requirements may need refinement
- ⚠️ Tech stack dependencies not yet validated
- ⚠️ Initial task breakdown pending

**Next Steps:**

1. Validate project structure (Phase 0)
2. Refine NEURONS.md based on actual codebase
3. Break down core features into atomic tasks
4. Begin incremental implementation

## Planning Session Log

### {{TIMESTAMP}} - Initial Bootstrap

**Context:** First Cortex planning session after project creation.

**Actions Taken:**

1. Created initial workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with Phase 0 tasks
2. Validated generated project structure
3. Documented strategic context

**Decisions Made:**

- Start with infrastructure validation (Phase 0)
- Use incremental approach: setup → core → features → polish
- Leverage Brain skills for common patterns

**Next Session:** After Phase 0 completion, analyze results and plan Phase 1

## Knowledge Gaps

(To be captured as project progresses)

---

## Success Metrics

From THOUGHTS.md:

- {{SUCCESS_CRITERIA}}

**How to Measure:**

- Ralph completes tasks without blocking
- Verifier passes consistently
- Project goals achieved incrementally
- Knowledge gaps captured and addressed

---

## Notes for Future Sessions

- Review Ralph's workers/ralph/THUNK.md for patterns and blockers
- Update NEURONS.md as project structure evolves
- Capture reusable patterns in Brain skills/
- Promote decisions to DECISIONS.md when patterns emerge
