  - **Goal:** Ensure Ralph can execute basic tasks
  - **Context:** Fresh project setup, need to validate infrastructure
  - **AC:**
    - [ ] Run `bash loop.sh` completes without errors
    - [ ] Verifier runs and produces `.verify/latest.txt`
    - [ ] workers/ralph/THUNK.md created with first entry
  - **If Blocked:** Check loop.sh syntax, verifier rules, file permissions

- [ ] **0.2** Document project structure in NEURONS.md
  - **Goal:** Validate and refine NEURONS.md generated structure
  - **Context:** Generated NEURONS.md may need project-specific adjustments
  - **AC:**
    - [ ] All directories in "Directory Structure" exist or are planned
    - [ ] Key files are documented with purpose
    - [ ] Tech-specific guidance is accurate
  - **If Blocked:** Refer to project idea file for intended structure

### Phase 1: Core Setup

(Tasks to be added by Cortex based on project goals)

## Notes for Ralph

- This is your first project with Cortex management
- Check `cortex/THOUGHTS.md` for strategic context
- Tasks will be synced from `workers/workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` automatically
- Focus on one task per iteration (atomic completion)
