# THUNK - Completed Task Log

Persistent record of all completed tasks across IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md iterations.

Project: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
Created: {{CREATION_DATE}}

---

## Era: {{INITIAL_ERA_NAME}}

Started: {{CREATION_DATE}}

| THUNK # | Original # | Priority | Description | Completed |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | EXAMPLE | HIGH | Example completed task - replace with first real completion | {{CREATION_DATE}} |

## How THUNK Works

**Purpose:** Permanent append-only log of all completed tasks from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

**Key Concepts:**

- **THUNK #** = Globally sequential number (never resets, always increments)
- **Original #** = Task number from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (e.g., "1.1", "T5.3")
- **Era** = Logical grouping of tasks from a plan phase

**Auto-Append Behavior:**

- When you mark a task `[x]` in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, `thunk_ralph_tasks.sh` detects it
- Task is automatically appended to THUNK.md with next sequential THUNK #
- Duplicate prevention: Tasks are matched by description to avoid re-adding

**Monitor Integration:**

- `current_ralph_tasks.sh` - Shows only uncompleted `[ ]` tasks
- `thunk_ralph_tasks.sh` - Shows completed tasks from this file

**Hotkeys in thunk_ralph_tasks.sh:**

- `[r]` - Refresh display (clears screen, re-reads THUNK.md)
- `[f]` - Force sync (scan IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for new completions)
- `[e]` - Start new era (prompts for name)
- `[q]` - Quit monitor

## Notes

- This file is append-only; never delete entries
- Display can be cleared with `[r]` hotkey, but log persists
- Each project gets independent THUNK numbering (starts at 1)
- When starting a new plan phase, use `[e]` to create a new Era section
